// Ordinal Numbers: Ordinal numbers indicate their position in a array, such as 1st or 2nd.
//  Most ordinal numbers end in th, except 1, 2, and 3.
// • Store the numbers 1 through 9 in a array.

// • Loop through the array.

// • Use an if-else chain inside the loop to print the proper ordinal ending for each number. 
// Your output should read "1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th", and each result should be on a separate line.
let mynumber=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];


// for loop
for(let i = 0;i<mynumber.length; i++){
    // now we use condition
if (mynumber[i]==1){
    console.log(`${mynumber[i]}st`);
}else if(mynumber[i]==2){
    console.log(`${mynumber[i]}nd`);
